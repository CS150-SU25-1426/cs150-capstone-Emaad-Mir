# CS150-Capstone

# Sources I Used 

For the most part, I used ChatGPT (and some of my own code from previous assignments) to assist me in creating this phase of the project. Most of what ChatGPT helped me with involved reminding me about important things related to certain functions. For example, ChatGPT reminded me to include "const" at the end of all of my getter functions since I am not modifying the values of the member variables in those functions. I also used ChatGPT when I had questions about how certain things worked. For example, I used shortened names for all of my attributes in the parameterized constructor, but to ensure I was on the right track, I clarified with ChatGPT if I could use those shortened names for the rest of my program. 

For phase 2, I used the structure of the surfboard assignment and some ChatGPT to help me with the project. I was able to do everything without using much AI except for when it came to making the function to edit a TV show object. Previously, I thought that I would just need to use the setters in the function, but after going through it with AI, I realized what I was missing and was able to figure out that I needed switch statements. I mostly used ChatGPT to look through my code to make sure it was good and that I didn't miss anything, such as a break statement at the end of each case. 

# What Went Well + What Could Have Gone Smoother

Overall, I'd say making this project went mostly well because of all the practice I got to apply classes and other concepts in the assignments we have done for homework. To make creating this project more fun, I decided to make it keep an inventory of something I like to do, which is binge watch all kinds of TV shows! I did very well in declaring and defining all of my functions in the proper places and making sure that I was not programming something that could not happen. I think where everything could have gone smoother was fully understanding overloading operators, as I did find myself having to go back and watch that lecture video before I could apply it to my own project.
